"# URI.js  URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc). It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.  URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).  ## API  ### Parsing     URI.parse('uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body');    //returns:  //{     //  scheme : 'uri',     //  userinfo : 'user:pass',     //  host : 'example.com',   //  port : 123,     //  path : '/one/two.three',    //  query : 'q1=a1&q2=a2',  //  fragment : 'body'   //}  ### Serializing    URI.serialize({scheme : 'http', host : 'example.com', fragment : 'footer'}) === 'http://example.com/#footer'  ### Resolving     URI.resolve('uri://a/b/c/d?q', '../../g') === 'uri://a/g'  ### Normalizing      URI.normalize('HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html') === 'http://abc.com/~smith/home.html'  ### Comparison     URI.equal('example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D', 'eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d') === true  ### IP Support   //IPv4 normalization    URI.normalize('//192.068.001.000') === '//192.68.1.0'   //IPv6 normalization    URI.normalize('//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]') === '//[2001:0:db8::1]'    //IPv6 zone identifier support  URI.parse('//[2001:db8::7%25en1]');     //returns:  //{     //  host : '2001:db8::7%en1'    //}  ### IRI Support    //convert IRI to URI    URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://exampl√©.org/ros√©')) === 'http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'     //convert URI to IRI    URI.serialize(URI.parse('http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9'), {iri:true}) === 'http://exampl√©.org/ros√©'  ### Options  All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:  *   `scheme` (string)   Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.  * `reference` (string)    If set to `'suffix'`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.  *    `tolerant` (boolean, false)     If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.  * `absolutePath` (boolean, false)     If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.  *   `iri` (boolean, false)      If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  *  `unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)   If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  * `domainHost` (boolean, false)   If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).  ## Scheme Extendable  URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:  *    http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\] *  https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\] * mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\] *    urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\] *   urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]  ### HTTP Support      URI.equal('HTTP://ABC.COM:80', 'http://abc.com/') === true  ### Mailto Support      URI.parse('mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!');     //returns:  //{     //  scheme : 'mailto',  //  to : ['alpha@example.com', 'bravo@example.com'],    //  subject : 'SUBSCRIBE',  //  body : 'Sign me up!'    //}     URI.serialize({         scheme : 'mailto',      to : ['alpha@example.com'],         subject : 'REMOVE',         body : 'Please remove me',      headers : {             cc : 'charlie@example.com'      }   }) === 'mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me'  ### URN Support      URI.parse('urn:example:foo');   //returns:  //{     //  scheme : 'urn',     //  nid : 'example',    //  nss : 'foo',    //}  #### URN UUID Support      URI.parse('urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6');     //returns:  //{     //  scheme : 'urn',     //  nid : 'example',    //  uuid : 'f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6',  //}  ## Usage  To load in a browser, use the following tag:     <script type='text/javascript' src='uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js'></script>  To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:      npm install uri-js  Then, in your code, load it using:      const URI = require('uri-js');  If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:   import * as URI from 'uri-js';  Or you can load just what you need using named exports:     import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from 'uri-js';  ## Breaking changes  ### Breaking changes from 3.x  URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.  The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.  ### Breaking changes from 2.x  URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.  ### Breaking changes from 1.x  The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.  ## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))  Copyright 2011 Gary Court.

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// → {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// → {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

<!-- 🚨 HEY! HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->

## Wut? Poppers?

A popper is an element on the screen which "pops out" from the natural flow of your application.  
Common examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.


## So, yet another tooltip library?

Well, basically, **no**.  
Popper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element
to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  

The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**
(similar to middlewares or plugins).  
The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  
It's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).

### Popper.js

This is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to
the poppers.

Some of the key points are:

- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);
- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
- Supports Shadow DOM elements;
- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;

Visit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).


### Tooltip.js

Since lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,
we created **Tooltip.js**.  
It's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  
Its API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be
easy to integrate it in your projects.  
The tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.

Find [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).


## Installation
Popper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |
| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |
| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |
| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |
| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |
| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

Tooltip.js as well:

| Source |                                                                                  |
|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |
| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |
| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |
| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |
| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |

\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  
For more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).

### Dist targets

Popper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.

- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;
- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;
- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;

Make sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.

## Usage

Given an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button

```js
var reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
var popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
var anotherPopper = new Popper(
    reference,
    popper,
    {
        // popper options here
    }
);
```

### Callbacks

Popper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after
the popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.

```js
const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    onCreate: (data) => {
        // data is an object containing all the informations computed
        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow
        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation
    },
    onUpdate: (data) => {
        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates
    }
});
```

### Writing your own modifiers

Popper.js is based on a "plugin-like" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated "modifiers".  
A modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  

To learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)


### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration

Integrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because
they usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  
Popper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,
you can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using
your library of choice.  

For a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing
frameworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.

Alternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and
integrate Popper.js by yourself!

```js
function applyReactStyle(data) {
    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper
};

const reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');
const popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');
new Popper(reference, popper, {
    modifiers: {
        applyStyle: { enabled: false },
        applyReactStyle: {
            enabled: true,
            fn: applyReactStyle,
            order: 800,
        },
    },
});

```

### Migration from Popper.js v0

Since the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to
Popper.js v1.  

https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62

Feel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.

### Performances

Popper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  
This means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.

## Notes

### Libraries using Popper.js

The aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to
be used in 3rd party libraries.  

Visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.
